Extract weather query parameters from the following user request:

"{query}"

Extract the following parameters:
1. city: The city name the user is asking about
2. country: The country code (if specified)
3. units: 'metric' or 'imperial' based on user preference
4. forecast_days: Number of days for forecast (0-7), 0 means current weather only

Return your answer in this exact JSON format:
{{
    "city": "extracted city name",
    "country": "extracted country code or null",
    "units": "metric or imperial",
    "forecast_days": number from 0-7
}}

If a parameter is not specified, use these defaults:
- city: Must be extracted from the query (no default)
- country: null
- units: "metric"
- forecast_days: 0 for current weather, or appropriate value if forecast is requested

Determine forecast_days based on whether the user is asking about:
- Current weather (0 days)
- Tomorrow/next day (1 day)
- This week/next few days (3-5 days)
- Extended forecast (7 days)
